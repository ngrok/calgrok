/**
 * The Slated mark and wordmark.
 *
 * The mark is a calendar tile with one day filled in: the day a piece of work
 * is slated for. It is inlined as SVG rather than loaded from `/favicon.svg` so
 * it paints with the first render and needs no extra request. Colors are fixed
 * to the brand blue instead of `currentColor`, because the mark has to read the
 * same way on the light and dark surfaces mantle gives us.
 *
 * Geometry note: the tile is drawn as two rects behind a clip path rather than
 * as a rounded rect plus an arc-capped band. That keeps the band a straight
 * line, and it leaves the day grid inset by 4 at the sides and 3.5 above and
 * below, which reads as even. Sizing the band with an arc instead pushed the
 * bottom row to within 1.5 of the tile edge, and it showed at 16px.
