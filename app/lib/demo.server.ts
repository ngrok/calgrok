 * The demo calendar: a fake Linear workspace, generated on the server, so the
 * grid can be seen (and screenshotted) with no API key and no real content
 * plan. Turned on with SLATED_DEMO=1; `pnpm demo` sets it for you.
 *
 * Two properties matter, and everything here follows from them.
 *
 * 1. It is deterministic. Every issue is derived from its month and its
 *    template, never from Math.random(), so the same day holds the same cards
 *    on every request. Month grids overlap at their edges (the June grid runs
 *    to early July), and two overlapping requests have to agree or cards would
 *    flicker between months.
 * 2. It is anchored on today. Statuses are picked relative to the current date,
 *    so past days read as shipped and future days as planned however long from
 *    now the demo runs.
