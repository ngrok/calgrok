Your content plan already lives in [Linear](https://linear.app), with due dates,
labels, and assignees on every issue. Linear just won't show it to you as a
month grid.

Slated is that grid. It reads your issues from the Linear API, places each one
on the day it's due, and moves it when you drag it. It stores nothing itself, so
Linear stays the only source of truth.

<!--
  TODO: add the lead screenshot at docs/screenshot.png, then uncomment.
  Run `pnpm demo` and capture the month grid at http://localhost:3100 at 1440px
  wide. It needs no API key and generates the same workspace every time.

## What you get

Slated:

- Places every issue on a month grid by its due date, treated as the publish
  date.
- Puts projects on the same grid by their target date, on by default and
  switchable under **Options**.
- Reschedules an issue or project the moment you drop it on a new day. The card
  moves first, then rolls back if Linear rejects the write.
- Opens any issue in a modal to read its description and edit the due date or
  tags. Clear the date to drop it off the calendar.
- Creates issues in place. Hover a day, hit `+`, and set a title, team, due
  date, status, priority, and tags.
- Discovers your teams from Linear, then filters by team and label.
- Keeps the rest under one **Options** menu: view toggles, theme, and a manual
  sync. Both persist between visits, and the theme follows your system until you
  pick one.

## Quickstart

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org) 20 or newer,
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), and a personal Linear API key from
[linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/slated.git
cd slated
pnpm install
pnpm setup:env    # asks for your API key, writes .env (not `pnpm setup`)
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

Reload the page on your first run. Vite optimizes dependencies during that first
load, and the buttons do nothing until it finishes.

One variable, and no OAuth app to register:

```
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Slated has no access control of its own.** Everyone who reaches the server
> holds your Linear read and write access, and every issue they touch is
> attributed to you. Keep it on `localhost`, or put authentication in front of
> it (see [Deploying](#deploying)).

> [!NOTE]
> **Your workspace may not allow this.** Linear admins control personal API keys
> under **Settings > Administration > API**. If that page won't issue one, ask an
> admin.

### See it without Linear

`pnpm demo` runs the real calendar against a generated workspace: invented
teams, projects, and a few months of content that never shipped.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm demo         # http://localhost:3100
```

There's no `.env` and no Linear request. Dragging and the new-issue dialog work,
with edits held in memory until you stop the server. It runs on 3100 so it won't
collide with a real instance on 3000.

It's deterministic and anchored on today: the same day holds the same cards on
every run, and the past always reads as shipped.

## Configuration

Every value goes in `.env` (see [`.env.example`](./.env.example)).

| Variable | Required | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Yes | A personal key from [linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api). Slated acts as its owner, and it stays server-side. |
| `LINEAR_TEAM_DEFAULT` | No | Comma-separated team keys (`GTM,CON`) preselected on a first visit. |
| `LINEAR_LABEL_NAMESPACE` | No | Scopes the calendar to labels under a prefix (`con/`), and strips it in the UI. |
| `LINEAR_PROJECT_LABEL` | No | The project label (`Content`) that decides which projects reach the calendar. Comma-separated for several. |
| `SLATED_DEMO` | No | Set to `1` to serve the demo calendar instead of Linear, with no API key and no Linear request. |

Slated reads these once, at startup, so restart after you change `.env`. A stale
`LINEAR_PROJECT_LABEL` silently empties the calendar of projects. The
**Options** menu names the label it's filtering on, so check there for the value
the server actually holds.

### Adapting it to your workspace

Slated discovers your teams and **fetches nothing until you select one**, so an
empty first load usually means no team is picked. `LINEAR_TEAM_DEFAULT` seeds
that selection, and every team stays available to toggle.

Leave `LINEAR_LABEL_NAMESPACE` blank and labels stay optional filters. Set it to
`con/` and only those labels are offered, with the prefix stripped in the UI and
unfiltered views narrowed to issues carrying one.

Projects filter the same way, first by selected teams and then by
`LINEAR_PROJECT_LABEL`. Project labels are workspace-level in Linear rather than
per-team, so this one is a plain name instead of a prefix. The header's label
filter doesn't touch projects: Linear keeps the two label sets separate.

## Deploying

Anything other people can reach needs access control in front of it.

A container image ships for every commit on `main`:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/ngrok/slated:latest
```

Pin an exact build with `ghcr.io/ngrok/slated:sha-<commit>`, or build it
yourself:

```bash
docker build -t slated .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env slated
```

Bind it to `localhost`, or front it with something that authenticates visitors.
Slated serves the calendar to whoever asks.

## How it works

Slated is a [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) app that talks to Linear
from the server. The API key stays in the server's environment and every request
is proxied, so it never reaches the browser. There's no database: the browser
caches what it fetches for the session with
[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query). The UI uses
[mantle](https://mantle.ngrok.com), ngrok's design system.

[`docs/design.md`](./docs/design.md) is the original design doc and build log,
including the performance work that drove the rebuild. It describes an OAuth
flow Slated no longer has.

## Why we built it

We plan a lot of content at ngrok, and our issues already lived in Linear. The
calendar we'd been using on top of them froze the browser tab often enough that
people stopped opening it. Slated is the rebuild, designed around performance
from the start.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # dev server on :3000
pnpm demo         # generated demo calendar on :3100, no API key
pnpm test         # vitest
pnpm typecheck    # react-router typegen + tsc
pnpm lint         # biome
pnpm fmt          # biome, writing fixes
pnpm build        # production build
```

CI runs lint, typecheck, tests, and the build on every pull request.

## Heads up

This is an internal ngrok tool we're sharing as-is. It's shaped around how our
GTM and Content teams work, though it's configurable enough for another Linear
workspace. It isn't a supported product, so we may not take issues or pull
requests. Fork it and make it yours.
